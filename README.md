free form deformation

Based on the Free form Deformation Techniques as described by Sederberg & Parry, the application allows for real-time deformation of an object via manipulation of control points attatched to the model.

Manually adjust the lattice to make the character more anime-like:

Subsequent features need to include automatic deformation based on the relative position and angle between the camera and the character's face.
